Project Structure

HTML Structure

The HTML file is organized into different sections:

1. Header (Title Section)

Displays a styled title "Incredible India Journeys" with colorful text using <span> elements. Each word has a distinct color to enhance the visual appeal.



2. Card Section (Tourist Attractions)

Three cards are used to represent iconic locations in India:

Gateway of India

Hawa Mahal

Taj Mahal


Each card includes an image, a heading <h3>, and a short description in a <p> tag.



3. Footer Section

This section provides an "About Us" description split into three mini-paragraphs, explaining the purpose of "Explore Bharat."

It also includes a contact information line.




CSS Breakdown

The CSS enhances the page layout and visuals using various techniques:

1. Global Styles

body: Uses perspective to create a 3D effect, though subtle on a flat webpage.

Font imports from Google Fonts (Exo and Abel) to style headings and paragraph text.



2. Title Section

.title: Centers the title text and assigns each word a unique color using .color1 to .color5 classes.

font-size: 50px is used for large, bold typography.



3. Card Section

.card: Each card has a 3D effect applied using transform properties. The cards are animated to rotate and lift when hovered over.

.card1, .card2, .card3: These classes position the cards side-by-side with different color gradients and slight animation effects for each.



4. Image Styling

.card img: Adjusts the size and alignment of images inside each card to maintain a clean layout.



5. Footer Section

.footer: Positioned below the cards with a subtle border and shadow effect to make it stand out.

Uses text-align: center for proper alignment of content, and a teal color scheme for contact information.
